# NOTES:
#1. No quotes around the following
#2. Relative paths, such as the following, will work in most situations.
#3. If you are using Docker for Windows and are issuing docker commands from the
#   Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) you should do the following:
#   a. Work from a git repo that is checked out "on the windows side", and so you would
#      access it from the WSL shell from a path that looks like this:
#	  /mnt/c/Users/<user>/...
#   b. Specify absolute path value in these two environment variables (no trailing slashes, please).
#   c. The abosolute path should use the modern path syntax.  See the examples in the commented out
#      values that follow.
